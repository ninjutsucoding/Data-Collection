# Data-Collection
Module 11

The code was made by looking at Weekly assignments and also getting help by XLA.

This Module was scrapping data from two websites about Mars.    One of the webpages had the data inside a table.   
I could not figure out how to do the last visualization in Part 2.  I'll have to try to work on it another time.
